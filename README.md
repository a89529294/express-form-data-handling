## Validation Chains Pitfall

Example of Safe Reuse:
If you define a base validation chain and reuse it without further modifications, you won't run into the problem:

```js
const baseEmailChain = body("email").isEmail(); // Base chain, no further modifications

app.post("/login", baseEmailChain, handleLoginRoute); // Safe to reuse without modifications
app.post("/reset-password", baseEmailChain, handleResetPasswordRoute); // Safe to reuse without modifications
```

In this scenario:

Both the /login and /reset-password routes will use the baseEmailChain, which checks if the email field contains a valid email.
Since you're not chaining any additional methods or modifying baseEmailChain in either route, there is no risk of unintended side effects.
When It’s Unsafe:
The problem occurs only when you modify the shared chain after it’s been created:

```js
const baseEmailChain = body("email").isEmail(); // Base chain

app.post("/login", baseEmailChain, handleLoginRoute); // Uses the base chain as-is
app.post(
  "/signup",
  baseEmailChain.custom(checkEmailNotInUse),
  handleSignupRoute
); // Modifies the base chain
```

Here, modifying baseEmailChain with .custom(checkEmailNotInUse) in the /signup route would also affect the /login route because both routes share the same baseEmailChain object.

Summary:
Safe: Reusing a base validation chain without further modification.
Unsafe: Reusing a base validation chain and then modifying it (e.g., by chaining additional validators or methods).
If you only need the base functionality without any modifications, reusing the chain as-is is completely fine.
